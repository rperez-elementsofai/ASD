Anomaly Skin Detector

Building AI Course Project

Summary

The project's goal is to provide a tool, that would allow skin doctors for easier and better selection of patients with potential skin problems.

Background

When searching for skin problems the experience is the only tool a doctor usually have.  It would be nice to have a tool that help them with a first “triaje” if there are any problem. 

How is it used?

The solution would be available in the form of phone application connected with an AI server in the cloud. 
The use itself would be very simple, just take a photo of a skin area with the app and it will answer with a probability of anomaly.

Data sources and AI methods

Data sources would be images and hospital records and AI methods could be based in Convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

Challenges

Hospital records are very sensible information. They should be anonymized before processing.
Experienced doctors should only use the tool as a first input. Patients are not allowed to access it because of false positives.

What next?

Start negotiating with potentially interested hospitals around the globe.
